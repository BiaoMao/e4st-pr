Changes since 1.0b2
-------------------

1/9/17
    - Fix bug in shadow price of total_output constraints.
    - Add inputs for total_output constraint to results struct.
    - Add inputs and outputs for caplim constraints to results struct.
    - Reduce problem size by removing legacy physical ramping constraints
      between "base" and other hour types.
    - Reduce problem size further by removing legacy inc/dec variables
      and corresponding constraints.

12/26/16
    - Fix bug for cases with interface limits that are defined (in
      mpc.if.map) but not constrained (included in mpc.if.lims).
    - Fix bug that caused numerous shadow prices to be indexed wrongly
      when maxbuild limits were used.
    - Added lower limit on build capacity of subsets of generators to
      complement existing maxbuild restrictions. Renamed input parameters:
        mpc.maxbuild.map      --> mpc.caplim.map
        mpc.maxbuild.capacity --> mpc.caplim.max
      and added optional mpc.caplim field: mpc.caplim.min.
    - Improve testing of E4ST, i.e. e4st_solve(), including testing
      of new lower limit on build capacity (add t_e4st_caplim.m).


Changes since 1.0b1
-------------------

2/18/16
    - Release version 1.0b2.

2/16/16
    - New manual in LaTeX.

2/10/16
    - Modifications to make code compatible with non-public data cases.

1/29/16
    - Rename variables and files to E4ST*.

1/28/16
    - Add option interface and set default solver.

1/26/16
    - Add extras/feval_w_path.m.


Changes since fork
------------------

1/4/16
    - Release version 1.0b1.
    - Update User's manual.
    - Remove extraneous trailing'\' from paths in LtInputFiles.m.

1/3/16
    - Create 3-bus tests model.
    - Remove code files related to specific runs or specific machines.

12/23/15
    - Merge in setup code files from Biao.

12/21/15
    - Add e4st_ver().
    - Use apply_changes() instead of apply_contingency() (included
      in extras directory), since apply_changes() and idx_ct() are expected
      to be included in MATPOWER 6.
    - Minor edits to output text headers.
    - Fork e4st from sopf and rename functions:
        c3sopfi() -> e4st_solve()
        sopf_args() -> e4st_args()
        offer2mat() -> e4st_offer2mat()
